## Recube
A new Minecraft server implementation in C# which aims to be high-performance & extensible.

## Current status
We are currently in heavy development and pre-alpha. So expect alot of missing features and bugs.
Also, please note that we're doing this as an hobby project, so please don't judge us for slow development :)!

## Introduction
Recube is a fairly new open-source Minecraft server implementation, written entirely in C#.
The goal is to create a new, fast and highly extensible server (e.g. you have full access to the network part and can interpolate it)
